# Flutter Meals App

The Flutter Meals App is a user-friendly mobile application designed to help users decide what to cook by providing detailed information on a variety of dishes. With this app, users can explore different food categories, view ingredients, cooking steps, preparation time, and cost (pricey or cheap) for each dish. Users can also save their favorite meals for easy access later on, and the app ensures that their preferences persist even after closing the app.
